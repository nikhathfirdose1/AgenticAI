LangChain is a powerful framework designed for building applications with large language models (LLMs). It provides components for chat models, embeddings, memory, agents, tools, and vector stores.

LangChain supports integration with OpenAI, Hugging Face, Google Gemini, and many more APIs. It is commonly used for Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), chatbots, document QA systems, and autonomous agents.

One of the key features is the ability to combine a chat model with a vector store to answer queries based on custom document knowledge. LangSmith can be used to trace and debug LangChain applications in real time.
